The text file is batch of Telnet commands that only works if the text line ending or End-of-line is encoded/saved in LF, which is common encoding format in GNU/Linux.
The previous unmodified version was saved in Excel format and developed in Windows environment, thus never worked in Putty/terminal emulator.
I've added various command that found in iBright telnet commands that support "wait", and folder creation which greatly reduce labor time and typos.
